Changelog 
=========

To make a good changelog file, we must make a good commit description.
Changelog uses the following categories to distribute the documentation:

1. Features: Commits that add new functionality.
2. Fixes: Commits that address bugs.
3. Chores: Commits that are maintenance tasks or refactors.
4. Breaking Changes: Commits that introduce backward-incompatible changes.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

Tagging a new version
+++++++++++++++++++++

Tag a new version is done when enough advances were done.

.. code-block:: python
    
    git tag v1.1.0
    git push origin v1.1.0
    ./push_changelog.sh
