SAO
===

SAO is a joint project that provides a variety of tools to simulate light propagation, atmosphere modeling, and more. It is based on our common usage practices and explores new areas of study.

Installing via .yml File
------------------------

The project includes an `environment.yml` file that installs all the required dependencies to ensure proper functionality. Use the following command to create a Conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml

Installing via pip (Coming Soon)
-------------------------------

The pip installer will allow us to install the project as a library that can be imported as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install sao

Have you found a problem in SAO? Is there something you use often that you think should be included?
Please have a quick look at the source code and see if you can fix the problem or make an addition.
SAO is a collaboration between many AO scientists to try and make a well tested and reliable library 
of AO based functions. There isn't neccessarily a central "developer" to make significant changes, therefore if you think you can 
help then please get involved, make an issue, clone the code or make a pull request! Feel free to make an 
issue for discussion.
